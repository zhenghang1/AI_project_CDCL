    "# SAT Solver implemented using CDCL Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "SAT is the satisfiability problem wherein we are given some clauses containing propositional variables and the correspoding literals and we need to find whether the formula is satisfiable or unsatisfiable. A SAT Solver is a program that solves a SAT problem. Most of the state-of-the-art SAT solvers nowadays use the **CDCL (Conflict Driven Clause Learning)** algorithm to implement the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CDCL Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether the formula is SAT/UNSAT, the solver first picks a variable and assigns a boolean value to it. This is the **Decide** phase and is controlled by the decision heuristics used by the solver. Once the value is decided, the solver performs the **Boolean Constraint Propogation (BCP)** which is responsible for making implications after performing propogation once a variable is decided. Suppose we have a 3 literal clause (1,-2,3) and in the first 2 deciding steps, we set 1 as False and 2 as True. So, to make this clause true, we have to set 3 as true. This is basically what is intended by BCP. While the BCP makes implications, there can be 2 cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can reach a conflict. A conflict occurs if the BCP wants to set a variable v to the boolean value b but v has already been assigned !b (not b) either during decide phase or the BCP phase. Once this conflict occurs, the solver analyzes the conflict (**Analyze Conflict**) phase. \n",
    "    1. If the conflict arises at level 0 (level 0 is the level where no decisions have been made and all the implications are the ones directly made using the input formula), it means that the given problem is UNSAT (unsatisfiable).  \n",
    "    2. If the conflict is not at level 0, then the solver comes out with a conflict clause. This clause is such that it has to be true or unless this conflict will occur again. So, this clause is added to the initial set of clauses which prevents this conflict to occur again in the future. Once the conflict clause is decided, it is used to find the level (in the decision tree) to which the solver should **Backtrack** (backjump). In backtracking, the solver undoes all the assignments and implications made at the levels greater than the backtrack level and reaches the backtrack level with the conflict clause added. It starts BCP again and this continues until either there are no conflicts and we reach case 2 or there is a conflict at level 0 and we reach case 1A.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. All the implications implied by the latest decision are made and the solver again goes to the Decide phase. If there are unassigned variables left, then the solver picks a variable and value to be assigned to it based on the heuristic and starts BCP. Else if there are no unassigned variables left, the problem is SAT (satisfiable) as all the variables have been assigned without any conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the above algorithm is correct, but while solving some bigger problems, the solver can get stuck in a bad part and can spend redundant time there. If it would have taken another branch, the problem could have been solved earlier. To take care of this, we introduce **Restarts** in the solver. Restart heuristics analyze when has the solver stuck and makes the solver restart its computation. In restart, the solver undoes all the decisions and implications made on levels greater than equal to 1. The values used by the decision heuristic and the learned clauses are kept as is and these now lead to different set of variables being decided by the solver (as the decision heuristics and clause set is different now). Restarts have been found very effective and are used in all the state-of-the-art solvers.\n",

So, we have literals like 1, -2, 3 and so on. Let there be V number of variables. Positive literals are like 1,2,3,4...V and we store them like this only. For the negative literals, -1,-2,..-V, we will add V to its absolute value. That is, -1,-2,-3 ... -V will be represented by V+1,V+2..V+V. \n",

    "# 2-Watched Literals to fasten BCP\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies show that majority of the times, the SAT solver performs the Boolean Constraint Propogation (BCP) which is responsible for making implications after performing propogation once a variable is decided. A naive approach for doing so would be that whenever a variable is set, we traverse each clause and find such clauses where all but 1 literals have been falsed. This would be very expensive as we will have to traverse all the literals every time a decision is made. And as many decisions are made, BCP is indeed an important step and should be done faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fasten the BCP, we observe that if for any clause, we have 2 literals that are not set false, then it can not pariticipate in BCP at this step. This is because as both the literals are not false, then either atleast one is true which means that the clause is already valid and can not be used to conclude anything or both are not set, which means that there are atleast two literals not defined and thus we can not say anything about the clause at this step. So, for all clauses, we keep 2 watch literals all the time with the invariant that each of them is not false if the clause is not satisfied. Now, whenever we set a variable, say 2 as in the above example and we set it to true. This means that the literal -2 (5) has been falsed and so we only go to clauses watched by -2 and search for a new watcher for them. If we get a new watcher for them, then it is fine. Else we are left with only one undecided literal in it (the other watcher) as we get no watcher (not false literal) which means all other literals have been falsed and so the only undecided literal left is the other watcher and that is now implied.\n",

    "# Decision Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The time which the solver takes to solve the problem can be reduced drastically by choosing the variable to be assigned and value that it should be assigned intelligently. This is done with the help of decision heuristics used by the SAT Solver. We implement the following three decision heuristics in this solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ORDERED:** As seen above, the variables are represented as numbers 1,2,3 and so on. So, in this ordered decider, we pick the smallest (comparing the numbers representing the variables) unassigned variable and set it to True. To implement it, we traverse the list 1,2,3 .. V in this order and take the first variable which is unassigned and assign it True.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **VSIDS:** In the VSIDS (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum) like strategy, we prefer the literals that recently participated in the conflict resolution and set them first. We create an array of size 2\\*number of variables to store the scores of all literals and initialize it with all 0s. While reading the input file, the score of a literal is incremented by 1 whenever it appears in a clause. When ever a conflict occurs and a conflict cluase is created, we increase the score of all literals in that conflict clause by _incr (which is 1 initially) and _incr is increased by 0.75 after each conflict clause creation. This is done to give more weightage to the literals participating in the recent conflicts. While deciding, the unassigned literal with the highest score is chosen and is satisfied (if it is -v, v is set to False and if it is v, v is set to True)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MINISAT:** This is the heuristic as used by the MINISAT solver. It is on the lines of VSIDS with some modifications. Here, we maintain the score array for all variables (rather than the literals) and intialize the scores to 0. We also maintain a phase array which stores the last truth value assigned to each variable (whenever a variable is assigned, this phase array is updated). While reading the input file, the score of a variable is incremented by 1 whenever a literal corresponding to it appears in a clause. When ever a conflict occurs and a conflict cluase is created, we increase the score of all variables whose literals appear in that conflict clause by _incr (which is 1 initially) and _incr is divided by _decay (0.85) after each conflict clause creation. This is done to give more weightage to the variables participating in the recent conflicts. While deciding, the unassigned variable with the highest score is fixed. It is assigned the value it was assigned previously as stored in the phase array. This is called **phase-saving**. Phase-saving is beneficial as in a sense we are restarting the search for the solution of the problem by assigning the variable with the same value again. Conflicts that occured after this variable's assignment earlier lead to learning of conflict clauses which will now help in avoiding these conflict situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the VSIDS and MINISAT heuristic, we implemented a PriorityQueue (in the file [PriorityQueue.py](PriorityQueue.py)) which has efficient methods to add a variable in the queue, increase the score of a variable in the queue, removing the variable from the queue (when assigned) and getting the variable with maximum score from the queue. All these are written efficiently taking O(log(n)) time. The working of the methods can be seen from the PriorityQueue.py which has been fully documented as well.\n",

    "# Restart Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The restart heuristics mainly take the number of conflicts as the measure of the solver being stuck and restarts the solver when a certain number of conflicts have been reached. This limit is increased after each restart \n",
    "Restart techniques used by the state-of-the-art solvers were studied and the following two of them were tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GEOMETRIC:** In this approach, we have a conflict limit and whenever the number of conflicts go beyond the limit, we restart the solver. Before restarting, the number of conflicts is set to 0 as we consider conflicts only after restart and the conflict limit is now increased by multiplying it with a constant (limit multiplier). This increasing of the conflict limit ensures the correctness as the solver sees if the problem can be solved in the fixed number of conflicts and if it is not solved, the limit is relaxed. This technique is named so because the conflict limits follow a **Geometric Series**. In our implementation, we initialize the conflict limit with 512 and keep the limit mulitplier as 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LUBY:** In this approach, the number of conflicts between 2 restarts are determined by the Luby Sequence. The Luby Sequence was given by Luby et. al. in 1993 and has been proven as an optimized startegy for randomized search algorithms. It has also proven to be very successful in SAT algorithms. The Luby sequence is given as:\n",
    "![Images/luby.png](Images/luby.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Luby sequence thus looks like (1,1,2,1,1,2,4,1,1,2,1,1,2,4,8 ..). We have a base (512 in our implementation) and we multiply the base with the next luby number to get the conflict limit. So, the conflict limits in our implementation would vary like (512, 512, 1024, 512, 512, 1024, 2048 ...). Whenever the number of conflicts go beyond the limit, we restart the solver. Before restarting, the number of conflicts is set to 0 as we consider conflicts only after restart and the conflict limit is set to the next number in this list. This strategy tends towards more frequent restarts and completeness is guaranteed by the increasing upper limit on the number of conflicts. The Luby Sequence Generator has been implemented in the file [LubyGenerator.py](LubyGenerator.py) which is fully documented.\n",

    "# Analyzing Conflict and Backjumping\n",
    "\n",
    "We are implementing the CDCL (Conflict Driven Clause Learning) approach to solve the SAT problem. In this, whenever we have a conflict, we derive a conflict clause and add it to our clause database. Adding this clause will help the solver ignore this conflict path in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we create the Implication Graph, then a conflict clause can be thought of as a cut in the graph. A conflict clause has the sufficient literals such that if all are false together, then the same conflict will rise again and so this conflict clause should be true and thus is added to the clause database. But, there can be many potential conflict clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BackJumping\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal backtracking approach, whenever we reach a conflict, we backtrack one level and reverse that decision and try again. But, in the CDCL approach, we use the concept of backjump where we jump to a higher level which is decided by the conflict clause. Say the conflict occured at Level L. For all the literals in our conflict clause, we will take the levels at which they were set and find the maximum level less than L. Let's call this $L_{Backjump}$. We will then jump to $L_{Backjump}$ and undo all the decisions and implications that were made at levels greater than $L_{Backjump}$. \n",
    "<hr style=\"border:2px solid gray\"> </hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the right Conflict Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the level where conflict arised be L. We will choose a conflict clause that will have only one literal (say l) set at the level L. If this is the case, then as seen above, when we jump back using this clause, only this literal l will not be set and all other literals will be false and so we will have a new implication of l at that level which can then lead to further new implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This one literal l, set at the conflict level L will be chosen as the **first Unique Implication Point (UIP)**. A UIP in a implication graph is a node that occurs on all paths from the decision node at that level to the conflict node. First UIP is the UIP closest to the conflict node.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the conflict clause with only one node set at level L and that too, the first UIP, we use the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the clause C set as the clause that caused the conflict.\n",
    "2. Find out the latest assigned (implied) variable (say V) in C.\n",
    "3. Let the clause that caused the implication of V be C1.\n",
    "4. Set C to the binary resolution of C and C1 with respect to the variable V.\n",
    "   Binary resolution of Clause1 = (p1,p2,p3,...pn,a) and Clause2 = (q1,q2,q3,...qn,-a) with respect to the variable a is the clause (p1,p2,p3,...pn,q1,q2,q3,...qn)\n",
    "5. If C is such that it has only one literal set at L, then this is the final conflict clause. Else the steps\n",
    "   2-4 are repeated until the final conflict clause (with only one literal set at the conflict level L which also corresponds to the first UIP) is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "This clause is then added to the clause database and the SAT solver jumps to the level $L_{Backjump}$ as described in the previous section.\n",

    "The CDCL Algorithm was implemented efficiently using the Watched Literals, intelligent decision heuristics and restart strategies. The above statsitics show that the solver was able to solve all the 4 unsat instances very easily. The timeout limit of 100s was taken. Solver was able to solve 9 out of 13 SAT instances efficiently (max taking 55s). The statistics are shown above and the statistics and assignment of the variable is also stored in the results folder. The file [verifier.py](verifier.py) was used to verify the assignments given by the solver and all the assignments were found correct. The rest (bmc-10, bmc-11, bmc-12 and bmc-13) were quite big and though many options were tried, the solver was not able to compute them easily. "
